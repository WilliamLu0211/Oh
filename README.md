## APCS2 Final Project - Teemo
Proposal: [Our proposal](./docs/proposal.pdf)

### Description
Teemo has found himself trapped in a room filled with dangerous monsters that all want him dead. But poor Teemo is too afraid to move a muscle. It's up to you to save him. You can help Teemo move by pressing the W, A, S, and D keys (W is up, A is left, S is down, D is right). You can control the direction Teemo aims his blowgun at with your mouse. Enemy monsters come from all directions and Temmo must kill every single one of them. Lucky for you, some of monsters drop power-ups, which Teemo can use to do a bunch of cool stuff. Try to earn the highest score possible.
