## Teemo
  This is a 2D skill-based single player game. The player controls Teemo, the main character. The player moves Teemo by pressing the W, A, S, and D (W is up, A is left, S is down, D is right) keys . The player controls the direction Teemo aims at with the mouse, and fires his blowgun with the left mouse button. Enemy minions spawn at random positions at least a certain distance away from Teemo’s current position. They move in a random direction once spawned, and will continue to move in a straight line at a constant speed, and bounce off any walls they run into. They shoot at Teemo while they move. When Teemo kills a minion, there’s a chance that it drops an ability, diamond, or coin (10*, 20*, or 40*). Teemo has to run to them to pick it up. If they don’t get picked up, they will despawn after a certain amount of time. Try to earn the highest score possible.
  The project works using the computer language Processing. It has multiple classes for all necessary objects such as Teemo itself, minions, bullets, abilites, coins and all kinds of stuff. 
  
## Launching Instructions
  Run TeemoRun.pde in Processing. Make sure you full screen the interface.
  To play press the WASD keys to make Teemo move in the directions the keys point towards. Drag your cursor over the screen to have Teemo automatically shoot in your cursor direction. Dodge all the enemy minion bullets and shoot enemy minions for a chance for them to drop and ability or coiins. Coins and alive time and minion kills combined equate to points earned. Try to beat our high scores.
